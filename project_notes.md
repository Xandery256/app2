# Project Notes

## Python Notes

For our connections we need:

### GUI Side

- Homepage
  - Display table of services
  - Receive content requests
  - Return appropriate details page
- details
  - Display table with service data
  - Receive creation requests

### DB side

All we really need atm is a procedure call and a place to store that data to give it back to the GUI
